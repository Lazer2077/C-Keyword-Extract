Extract the Keyword from a C/C++ file

## Idea
- For this time,  we first care about the annotation and inCode (String, variable name) keyword, we should make judgement under these situation.
- After searching from the Internet, I decide using re module in python to match the basic function
- After Compelting level 1, the level can be easily extended if I design the logic clearly.
- For Worse considerasion,  dealling with the code with not annotation is needed (struct in one line)
- Easy way to think, dealling line by line is not good for complexity
